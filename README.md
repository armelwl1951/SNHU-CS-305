<b>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?</b>

Artemis Financial requested help with their customers data security, as they wanted to make sure that their clients were as protected as possible when accessing their information. Knowing that cybersecurity is extremely important for both client and company, I knew that they would need a strong foundation for their current system using industry standards such as algorithm ciphers, SSL certificates, and making sure their APIs were up-to-date with the needed security patches.

<b>What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?</b>

I believe that I did well testing for potential vulnerabilities in my code with static testing. Making sure that your code is secure is very important for the protection of your program and the program users. Leaked personal information and data breaches are a real world risk that affects all of us and leaves many people vulnerable to identity theft and the stress knowing that your private information is being passed around for someone else to use. Coding secure programs helps to keep this data secure and protects the companies reputation intact.

<b>What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?</b>

I liked the dependency check tool because it laid out all the vulneratbilities automatically without having to figure it out manually.

<b>How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?</b>

Most of the vulnerabilites found in the programs were outdated libraries, therefore the remedy was usually simple updates with the needed security patches. Penetration tests in the future will better assess the additional vulnerabilities within the code.

<b>How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?</b>

While coding I continually ran debugs in order to check it's functionality, which is an industry practice that ensures clean coding. After each refactor I reran the vulnerability checks to see if any new vulnerabilities popped up.

<b>What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?</b>

I Googled and used Stack Overflow a lot for these assignments, mostly due to the issues I was having with Eclipse and the keystore. One assignment I had to do in-depth research as to how to link the keystore to my program file which ended up requiring adding a new path to my Windows OS.

<b>Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?</b>

My use of a the hash function in order to send encrypted communications.
